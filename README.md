# Wind Energy Feasibility Dashboard

This project explores wind speed data to understand if a location is suitable for wind energy generation. I used Python and some popular libraries to analyze the data, visualize patterns, and forecast future wind speeds.

## Whatâ€™s in this project?

- Cleaned and prepared wind speed data
- Plotted wind speed trends over time
- Analyzed seasonal patterns (like which months are windier)
- Used the ARIMA model to forecast wind speed for the next 30 days

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.12
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Statsmodels (for ARIMA forecasting)  
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

## Getting Started

If you want to try this project:

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP
2. Make sure you have Python 3.12 installed
3. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the notebook file (dashboard.ipynb) and run it step-by-step

Data Source
I used the Weather Undergroud API from Kaggle. It contains wind speed and power data recorded over several months.

Why I Did This
This was part of my learning journey to understand how data science and forecasting can help in real-world problems. Wind energy is important for the future, and this was a good way to combine programming with sustainability.
